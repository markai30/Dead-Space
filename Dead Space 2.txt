We're getting conflicting reports from the colony. Can you say again?
God, what's happening down there?
This is flight team EG-9 to Control. We have completed the fly-by. There's nothing left. I repeat, Titan Station has been completely destroyed.
Negative. Nothing survived this, sir. Marker site 12 is a total loss.
You will hold your positions and you WILL FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS
Just stay focused and keep your area secured.    Tiedemann's evacuating the Sprawl, and the civilian population will be fine.
Cut the chatter!  Keep your eyes peeled for Clarke.  Stay tight.

I Agree
General Machette, this is Sergeant Fattouh, I've located the RIG signals for the remaining 143 sector G personnel. They are locked in and tracking to evac. Shuttle fleet confirms capacity, and are standing by. How did an evacuation get authorized? Tiedemann's going against every protocol for this situation. Now it's too late to stop it, and there's just a mad dash to get everyone off! He must feel responsible for what's happening, and is trying to save as many as he can.
Affirmative sir.  Fattouh out.

YOU CAN'T SURVIVE
NOT THIS TIME
YOU BASTARD
CONVERGENCE
Isaac, Isaac! You were drifting away for a moment there, Mr. Clarke. I believe you were telling me about your nightmares that you've been having - about your dead girlfriend. What was her name?
Yes, Nicole Brennan. She was a senior medical officer stationed aboard a Planetcracker class vessel...
The USG Ishimura, yes. Part of a mining operation on Aegis VII. I understand communications went down shortly after their arrival. You were part of the repair mission -- a mission for which you volunteered, am I right? What did you find aboard that ship, Isaac?
What did they find aboard that ship, Isaac? 
Did you have contact with this... Marker?
It made you see things, didn't it? Things you didn't want to see?
What did it say, Isaac?
What did it say to you, Isaac?
Isaac! Isaac! Can you hear me? Isaac?
Subject is Nolan Stross. Session one-five-eight.
Now...The eye is looking much better today?  Yes, don't you think?
Yes, I'll schedule you for another session tomorrow.
There... First thing tomorrow.
Now let's talk about what you saw today.
Come on, Stross. I'm here to help you.
And what did the symbols whisper to you?
Come on, Stross, what...
The symbols, Stross. What did the symbols tell you?
Put Mr. Stross back in stasis.  Adjust his medication up 30 milligrams and we'll try another session first thing in the morning.
Patient Four...  I remember you... Tiedemann said we... all the key subjects... need to be eliminated... terminated... what's one more?
... will it matter?
No one's getting out of here alive --  no one.
There is no escaping from what I've done.
Your RIG is red.  It's red.  There's a health pack and a flashlight in that wall locker.  You should grab them.
Go ahead. Take it.
I won't be needing it anymore.
Isaac... We're all gonna burn for what we did to you. 
Progress update on Isaac Clarke.  There's no doubt about it, he is a carrier, he displays an increasing obsession with his dead girlfriend - Nicole Brennan I'm starting him on a regiment of memory suppressants tomorrow. We can't risk another fatal aneurysm like Patient Three. Message end.
Will it matter?!

Isaac? Are you there? I'm so cold.
Isaac, are you there? Come in Isaac...
Oh God, I'm so sorry, Isaac... look at... the time difference... I'll call you back later...
Good. You were right, Isaac! The Ishimura is a great ship! I am so lucky to be serving aboard her.
Isaac,... thank you.
For... just pushing me to do this. I mean, if it weren't for you, I never would have made it this far, because you made me stick with it...
You know what we must be getting out of range of the relay.
Isaac?
I didn't want it to end like this. I really wanted to see you again... just once. I loved you. I always loved you.
How convenient. Destroy the Marker and all the hurt and pain go away. Imagine it, Isaac: You'll never have to listen to your heart.
How do you do it? How do you hold it all inside, your face never betraying your pain? No one would ever know the guilt you feel - never know the dark thoughts you keep.
Isaac...
Isaac!
How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.
MAKE US WHOLE!
I'm afraid, Isaac. I don't want to die. But it's the only way out.
I'm so cold, Isaac. It hurts. Where are you going? You can't run from the pain forever. Soon you'll beg for a way to end it all.
MAKE US WHOLE!
What's happening to you, Isaac? You tried to kill yourself. Why do you think that is?
That's right. Ignore the pain. Bury it deep inside. Let me fester - let me rot.
You're trapped now, Isaac. Just you and your decaying memories of me. How long can you ignore me? How long before your mind caves in? Sooner or later, you'll let your guard down. And I'll be waiting for you.
Still in denial? Afraid you're going to cut your wrists if you listen to me?
Oh, you claim I'm not real, and yet here I am.
How convenient. Destroy the Marker and all the hurt and pain go away. Imagine it, Isaac: You'll never have to listen to your heart.
How do you do it? How do you hold it all inside, your face never betraying your pain? No one would ever know the guilt you feel - never know the dark thoughts you keep.
The cracks are showing, Isaac, and the memories are seeping in.
And when they do, I'll be waiting for you.
We only had two years Isaac. Two years, but they were the best years of my life. I was happy - I had everything I wanted. Until you made me doubt myself.
Why would I choose the Ishimura over you? You said I'd regret passing up the chance - that the choice would haunt me forever. It was as if you wanted me to leave.
And when you received my final transmission, you couldn't bear to watch the end, could you? You knew what had happened yet, you went looking for me anyway. You knew deep down all you would find was death.
Why did you come looking for me if you knew I was dead, Isaac? Did you think I would forgive you? 
Who am I, Isaac?
You can pretend not to be bothered, but being here rattles you, doesn't it Isaac? All this plastic and tape covering the scars - trying to hide the blood and the bodies so no one will ever know. But you remember what happened - no matter how deeply you try to bury it.
Dammit! I can't stop the bleeding! Nurse! You hold him down! Hold him!
Dammit! Ok, I'm on the way. Take over here until I get back, alright?
Isaac, it's me. I wish I could talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. I wish I could just talk to someone...It's all falling apart here; I just can't believe what's happening...it's strange...such a little thing... In the end, it all comes down to just one little thing...I didn't want it to end like this. I really wanted to see you again...just once. I loved you. I always loved you.
Where are you going, Isaac? Do you still think I'm something you can avoid?
It was a shame what happened to Stross. That's what happens when you fight it.
How is it you still haven't come to terms with who I am? Who am I, Isaac? I will only ask you one more time before the end. Be ready.
Moment of truth, Isaac!  Who am I? Am I your friend? Your lover? The one shred; one light; one bright, shining star you clung to in this Universe? Or am I your guilt? Crushing the life out of you because you can't get over the fact that I'm dead? That you feel responsible? Who... Am... I?!? Why do you keep fighting me? Why can't you let go?
Wrong.
Step four: acceptance.
Now you're ready to finish this.
Are you ready to talk now?
A lot happened that we never wanted.  
Isaac, where are you going?
That's why I'm here Isaac...
...To show you the way... 
We're getting closer, Isaac. The Marker knows you're here.
When the time comes, you will.
Me. Us. Working together.
Yes. Are you ready? 
Yes. Step inside.
Follow the light, Isaac. I'll be waiting for you at the Marker.
You're fighting it, Isaac. You can't fight it. You have to let me go.
Isaac stop it. There is no other way. You have to do this. 
This is it, Isaac. Convergence is almost here. Meet me at the Marker. 
Goodbye, Isaac.
Make us whole!
MAKE US WHOLE!

"TEACHER REPORT: 3rd semester, 381-3

I know kids are supposed to have a vivid imagination, but this is getting ridiculous. Nearly half of my class has imaginary friends now, claiming that it's their deceased grandmother or something. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but it's getting harder and harder to get these kids to concentrate. This semester, I've sent more students to the time out chair than I have in all my twelve years of teaching. Maybe these kids are having trouble at home. I've also noticed parental involvement steadily decreasing this semester.

The Ishimura medical deck, Isaac. These were my last hours.  Frightened, cold, alone.  Well, go on Isaac. Don't be shy.
It must have come up from the colony! Goddammit! Hold him down! 
You never found my body, never said goodbye. Was I just stacked in the morgue with the others? Another random casualty?  Or did they turn me into one of them? Wearing my bloodied face, stalking the halls looking for more victims...
The barrier between us is wearing  thin, Isaac. Behind every tarp... a memory.  Behind every door of the passage of time from my life to when I died.
Why do you keep insisting these unpleasant memories are somehow my fault? This isn't about the Marker, Isaac. This is about you.
Isaac, are you there?
You were right, Isaac! The Ishimura is a great ship! I am so lucky to be serving aboard her.

Step one: Crawl inside. 
Step two: The screws go tight all around.
Cross my heart and hope to die...
Stick a needle in your eye.
They're all coming to the Marker. Convergence is at hand...
There's one thing I need you to understand, Isaac. When you destroy the Marker, the patterns in your head will be gone.
With the patterns gone, I will cease to exist. This is the last time we will ever see each other.
[Isaac, its me...]
[I wish I could talk to you. I...]
[Thank you Isaac, I always believed in you.]
Isaac... touch me.
Isaac, please. Make us whole. 
Isaac? I... Isaac... Can you hear me? Look, I'm gonna call you back as soon as I can, okay?
Isaac?
Isaac? Are you there? I'm so cold.
The needle is burning in my arm. Isaac? Where are you?
The room is getting dark. I can't see you. 
Isaac?
Step one: Crawl inside. 
Thank you Isaac.  Now....time to die.
Yours is the last body we need to be reborn!  The makers must be absorbed.
Not if we consume you first!
You will all be made one. Make us whole.
Your species will be consumed.
Give up Isaac.
Give in Isaac.

Orderly TPS Report 1138:  Patient 3 has again shit the bed.  Patient continues to draw what looks like a Marker in anything she can, including her own feces.   Her trembling hands have reached a point where she cannot feed, drink or bathe herself.  Her outlook is uncertain.  Entry end.
Orderly TPS Report 1411:  The patients are becoming agitated and combative with us, as a result of the new regimens of memory erasing drugs.   They no longer remember who we are from day to day, and must be convinced to leave their cells each morning.   Many are so frightened they require sedation to get to the interrogation chamber.   Orderly Gousetis was bitten 3 times by Patient six, who now must be told why he has a broken jaw every morning.   Entry end.
Orderly TPS Report 1418:  The recent realization that the popsicle sticks were being constructed into Marker-like miniatures for over a year has led to a search of the unit for any other such phenomena.   It appears wide-spread, with Marker forms being made out of medication bottles, hypodermic needles, and even toiletry items like nail clippers and tweezers.   The research teams have all been notified of the discovery.

It's in Government Sector!  It's in Government Sector! But we have to move  now, now... now... now! Time is running out for me... for us.
Isaac, the steps. He wants me to follow the steps.  Step one, crawl into the dark machine. 
He wants me to go into the dark machine, Isaac. I can't go. She's in there. She's waiting for me. 
Oh God... Oh God, oh God...
He's coming. Can't talk...
Where did he go? Where is he?!?
Isaac!
Hello, Isaac.
He's staring at me.  What is he waiting for?  I don't want to go into the machine now.  No more sessions. No more.
He's... waiting... for... me! 
No more sessions! Make him go away! Make him go away!
He'll hurt me! I'm not strong enough!
No, no... No... Ellie can help - but she doesn't see you. She doesn't believe in you - yet. One step at a time...
I need you to see him.  I need you to follow the steps!
He's staring at me, Isaac. Through the... holes... in his head.
Stop staring at me! Stop it! 
I just need you to see what I see, Ellie. I promise it won't hurt...
Shhhh...It's gonna be okay, I promise... this won't hurt a bit. 
Stick a needle in your eye!
There you are, Isaac.  We've been waiting for you! Now it's your turn!
<vocal react>
Step 3!
The steps.  She wants me to follow the steps.
Isaac? Isaac, I know you see the symbols too. They mean something!
We're a threat to them. I know it. We have to work together! ...Oh, my nose is bleeding? When did that start? Uhhh...
Isaac?  Isaac, are you there?  Can you hear me? 
No, no, no, no! It's not over. At least, not yet.
Isaac... Isaac, we built it. We can tear it down!
I...  It's in the Government Sector!  The Government Sector! But we have to move now! Now! Now! Now! Because time is running out for me... for us.
Isaac! They were afraid of us after the sessions, I remember!  They took us to the machine.  For our sessions. For the steps!
"You're lucky you don't remember.
When you do, he starts coming back."
Oh, look at you! You've grown up so much! Where are you going?
 It's dark - he'll find me in the dark!
Step 1, dark machine, we have to crawl into the dark machine. And then the screws, tight.

Step 1, Dark Machine.  Crawl into the dark machine. Step 2, the screws.  Screws go tight.  Time for another session.  More sessions.   More steps.  Dark Machine.  Cold and cramped.  Hard to breathe.  Hard to breathe.  Screws go tight. Tight tight tight.  "
But Daddy doesn't like the machine...Daddy doesn't like it.  It's cold and dark... and the walls are too close! They're too close!  Daddy doesn't like it, daddy doesn't like it son.  No, I don't wanna crawl inside.  It's too close, the walls are too close.
No, I'm not ready for the needle again! You have to let me out! I can't breathe! Let me out!
Ellie, you need to see him. If you follow the steps, I know you'll see him.  Step 3. You'll see, after Step 3.  No.
Step 3 Ellie.
Step four. She'll be waiting. She'll be waiting. She's always waiting. Staring. Asking. I don't know the answer. After the screws, after the needle, she'll be waiting.
Step four. She'll be waiting. 
After the screws, after the needle, she'll be waiting. 
No.  Stop saying that.  I'm not.  It's not true.  No no no.  I'm not I'm not.
I seeeee you!
I can't face it! I thought Ellie could. I had to make her see.  Step 3!
Her! It's what they were afraid of, that I'd face her, destroy the Marker.  But it's too much.  You have to help.  You need to see. Step 3.
Ellie lied!  She won't help.  But you will Isaac, you'll see her after Step 3.
Step 3!  Step 3! Oh God...
But son...no...no, listen...son, son...I...I...would never...I would never...
...I would never, I would never. But son, Daddy's not a murderer! I would never hurt you and Mommy.
Yes he is! You can't see him because you haven't taken the steps! The needle will make you see! Step three! Step three!
Step three, then you'll- AAAGHH!
she'll be waiting...1...2...3...4...staring...asking...after the screws after the needles...step three
Isaac!  Isaac!   Look out!
 Isaac?!  He's gone.  Listen, the steps can destroy the Marker.  Step 1, crawl into the dark machine.   Step 2, the screws go tight, all around...
Oh God, he's back! NO! No no no no no!
I just need you to see what I see, Ellie. I promise it won't hurt...
 There you are!  
You have to face her for me!  
See her!
Alexis, if you get this, I love you.   I would never do anything to hurt you, or our son. After the sessions, I keep seeing you, but...you're so mad, so...angry.   You're scaring me, I want you to stop. What's happening to me? Please come get me...
Tell her I didn't mean to do it! 
Tell her! 
Do you see her, Isaac? Is she waiting? Tell her I'm sorry. TELL HER I'M SORRY.    
There are four steps! 
One, two, three, four. 
Cross my heart and hope to die...

Shuttles 04 and 05 both needed repairs after going planetside. Pilots have been telling me all kinds of stories about what's going on down in the colony. A couple of murders, half the place is on antidepressants or sleeping pills, and everyone is ""jumpy as hell"", quote one PiC. Love to know what they've got against my shuttles, that's for sure."
Bonnie Worthington, Research log 16-671: It's the same signal. Dementia and codes and blueprints are all caused by the same signal from the Marker. It's the people that are different. Smart people "see" codes and blueprints, but to everyone else, it's just noise. Noise that drives you mad. 
"This is Bonnie Worthington!  It all makes sense now!  I have to leave this in case I don't make it out!     
We're objects of revenge!   The ""echo"" in our brain -- it's not an echo at all!  It's a genetic defense mechanism implanted from whoever, or whatever, created us.  They were fighting the Markers billions of years ago -- and they're still fighting them now, through us.    The Markers are some horrific revenge tool, planted like parasite wasp eggs on caterpillar larvae!   And we're the larvae!   We're the latest pawns in an eons long war!

Children of the Marker, we gather now to pay respect to the bodies of the dead, those who have been fortunate to be called ahead of us. Their bodies and souls go now into protective custody of the Church where they will be looked after and cared for. This is not an occasion for grief, but an occasion to rejoice. Let us always remember that death is a blessing. Just as all life comes from the Marker, all life will one day return to it. The body and soul will live on, with brothers and sisters, with family and friends, when the day of Convergence arrives. For this is what the Marker promises us and this is what we know to be true. Altman be praised.

Erin, Today we successfully installed 5 clone drives in the Project Telomere offsite data backup   The months and months of painstaking recruiting to sway disgruntled fringe employees to our cause has now paid off handsomely.  The janitor's  door codes were enough to trace the authorization route and point to which duplicate server was really in use.   The 5 drives were planted on the hull near that server this morning during the no-RIG spacewalks.   They will be retrieved with 2 billion petabytes of data each by tomorrow morning, assuming they are not discovered and scrubbed again.   We've employed dark-EM cloaking static in the hopes of thwarting the unknown method they employed to detect the last batch of clone drives.    As a bonus, we're also getting all security protocols and overrides  for Tiedemann's executive staff. Altman be praised, we should have enough data soon to begin the operation. Kanton Oddwick, vested, fully paid, out.
Erin, Kanton here.  We harvested our 5 cloning drives off the hull near Project Telomere's offsite data storage.  The wealth of information is truly breathtaking.  We now have confirmation of recombinent DNA experiments being conducted in stasis chambers in 3 locations, all on the underside of government sector near the TItan Mines.  A simple sabotage of any one of those will release them into the Mines. Kanton Odwick, vested, fully-paid, out

Allison Landers, this is Brandon Lurrach: Thank you for identifying Ishimura archive footage and RIG logs that could potentially contradict the official storyline of its demise at Aegis VII. It is critical that no word of the artifact's recovery ever be surfaced to the public. It is disturbing that such records still exist this many years after the incident. We have locked out your research team's access, and will be replacing them with EarthGov specialists effective immediately. Please contact me once the replacements arrive.

"TWO TINES ENTWINED

From the words of our savior, Michael Altman, we know that all life intertwines at the end to become one.   One mind, one body, one voice. The Marker  echoes this with its intertwined spires.   We echo this with our entwined arms, fingers touching in oneness at the top.  It is our sacred ceremonial gesture, used in greeting, and in the opening to all ceremonies, large and small."

Everyone move it!  Go go go! 
Sorenson, we'll leave some Plasma Cutters here for your group, it's the only thing that works!   God I hope you're right behind us....
Oh shit!  Message end!
All teams, this is  Kaleb, Xenogeologist from Langford Shift 1!   There's something in the facility, we've lost 3 of our crew, and can't contact Shift 4!
We're abandoning our shift and heading back up.  Everyone else is ordered to do the same.
Kaleb out! 
Kaleb to all shifts, report in.  Do you read me?  This is Langford Shift 1, we're almost back up top.

I can't read you. I'll leave these in log mode for you to follow, Kaleb out.
I'll leave this for who's left -- our crew is chasing us.  Our DEAD crew is chasing us.   It's just me and Ellie right now.   We're not gonna make it.
 No, no, I'll cover you while you make it.   They'll chase you down....before you can reach....the last bulkhead
I hear them coming.   Don't kill us both Ellie, just run.   I'll save you.  Just go.

We're with Ellie Langford's group.  We can't wait, these creatures are right on us, and they won't stay down. You guys better be right behind us, we're leaving a swarm of angry dead body parts behind us.    Where are you guys?

"INTERSTELLAR TOOLS OF THE TRADE

The Demise of Schofield Tools

Turmoil in the mining industry today as veteran equipment maker Schofield Tools was found guilty on all counts of fraud and mutiny.  Mutiny is not usually applicable in commercial cases, but due to the extreme penetration of Schofield Tool's products throughout the USG fleet, a ""defacto"" exception was made by Guild courts.
Trouble started earlier last year when Schofield Tools was purchased by the Arnold Conglomerate in a hostile takeover.  Almost immediately, minor clauses in Guild contracts were controversially re-interpreted to the tune of trillions of credits owed the Conglomerate.  The conflict quickly escalated to the charge of mutiny.
Then, as reported last month, the Arnold Conglomerate vanished overnight in a puff of accounting irregularities.  Arnold officials have since vanished, leaving Schofield Tools holding the bag for the fraud charges.
The courts have ordered Schofield Tools to divest all assets to Timson Tools, their closest Guild-licensed competitor.  The only asset allowed to remain in the hands of Schofield Tools will be their small pinecone production facility on Uranus."

HIT POINTS
"To anyone who may find this transmission:
There are people, even some of my own staff, who say I am a monster for what I brought to this station. They say the Marker is manipulative - that it influenced my decisions. They don't understand that what I did, I did for this community - for our species. Titan Station was a dead husk before I breathed life back into it with government research grants. That research - into unimaginable sources of energy, into manufacturing techniques and efficiencies far beyond all previous understanding - is the only hope that remains for mankind. We have relied on destructive planetcracking for far too long and now we can no longer sustain ourselves. We need the Markers to survive. If we fail in our efforts to understand them, there is no hope left for humanity.

"G10 LOCAL GRAVITY GENERATOR

To avoid damaging the G10 gravity core, this procedure should only be performed by a qualified Kinesis technician.

STEP 1: Use Kinesis to deploy the two outermost electromagnetic arms, holding the G10's outer ring steady.
STEP 2: Deploy the two middle arms, and steady the center ring.
STEP 3: Finally, deploy the innermost arms. This will steady the inner ring, and shut down the generator.

[Microwave interference may cause the electromagnetic arms to retract unexpectedly. If this occurs, use a Stasis module to hold them in place until the shutdown procedure is completed.]"

"To: All Government Employees

A number of security breaches have occurred in the past week that could have been avoided if proper protocol was followed. I'd like to take this time to remind employees that all government facilities are considered secure locations. Badges should be worn in a highly visible location at all times. Guests and civilians are not allowed beyond the atrium without a badged escort. Maintenance contractors from the CEC must present proper authorization papers and are to be escorted at all times. Let's keep our workplace safe and secure.

The dampening system built into the shielding around the Marker Test Beds SHOULD be blocking the signal entirely. But I swear the dementia signal is STILL getting through. Not a single thing registers on any sensor outside the shield walls. Put the same sensor inside with the Marker, and it goes off the charts. So we've either missed something entirely, or...I don't know what. You know, if we have, oh man, please heaven help us.

"TITAN STATION Quarterly Economic Report
CLASSIFIED:  Authorized Persons Only
**DO NOT FORWARD**

Titan Station unemployment grew unexpectedly to 9.5%, due to collateral job losses from the ongoing collapse of local planetcracking business.

The aftermath of the Ishimura incident continues to depress all planetcracking activity, as more and more support services go out of business, leaving less and less capacity for planetcracking.

However, Titan Station continues to post a small profit, buoyed solely by the cash influx from EarthGov's scientific research and operations facilities.   Human Needs and Services Organization has been spared the brunt of the planetcracking collapse by the pick-up in traffic with Government Sector.

Planetcracker docks, ships services, mining supplies and tool vendors continue to post heavy losses.
However the CEC itself has found moderate new life for its facility in the R&D department of the Government."

Unitology may sound like a bunch of kookey nonsense, but you've never really listened to what they have to say.   It's really beautiful.  It all makes sense.   They're not bad people, everyone just thinks that.    I know you won't come with me to the Church indoctrination, but please don't be mad at me anymore over this.   I'm just going to see what it's all about, and that's it.   So don't worry about me, and please call me.   I hate it when we fight.  okay, love you, bye.
Marion, it's Sally again.   Sorry I missed your call, I was busy....um...at...the Church thing I told you about.   I know, I've been spending a lot of time with them, but I love it there.   They're so welcoming and kind.   They really like me.   And they've invited me to become an Initiate!  I think I'm going to do it.   They've helped me see beyond our lives here in this universe, here in these bodies.  There's a beautiful oneness waiting for us all, after this life of anger and sadness...and disappointment.   There's a reading tonight at the Church sanctuary, so I may be there if you call.   I hope to talk to you soon, and don't worry about those forms they sent you, I can explain.  k, bye, love you.
Okay, Marion it's Sally,  I'm just going to leave this log here for you to find when you come get the rest of my stuff.   I hope I don't forget anything, this is a really big deal!   The "rebirth" is going to happen very very soon, just like they said!  This is a very special time, like, once in a lifetime.  Actually once in a million lifetimes!   They say we've been preparing for this since before we were human!  Do you know how special that makes us?  We're the ones who get to see it!  I'm so excited my skin is tingling.   I've got chills!  okay, I've got to go.  The ceremonies begin in a half-hour, I don't want to be late.  Bye sis, I love you so so much.   Come join us!  haha, k, bye.
I hope you're happy. I never wanted to come here, but you had to drag us to this shithole! And now look what's happened.  My baby girl turned into... something... I had to... how could you... how could you leave us alone? Do you hear me?  I HAD TO KILL MY BABY GIRL!
Help me. Someone...anyone...if you can hear me, please help.  Anyone? God, I...please help me...please God. Help.

Repair Status:
Examined the track system delivering coffins to the Crypt.   One Coffin was jammed inside.   Released gravity, TK'ed the coffin free (took several attempts, coffin damaged).

Examined the track system. Several support struts had broken free, warping the track.  The cold of the crypts caused brittleness in the poorly executed original welds.  Re-aligned the track, welded struts properly back in place.   Tested 5 coffins, all passed smoothly.

TITAN STATION:  CONQUERING A MOON, PART 1 of 2

Planetcracking first became feasible in the decades following the discovery of the Unified Field Theory, which allowed us to control the gravitron in the same manner we were accustomed to controlling the electron.

With the advent of large-scale applications of gravitron control, it became clear to the mining consortiums they had a new tool at hand.   Shockpoint drives were in their infancy, so extrasolar mining was out of the question -- and the dangers of planetcracking were still unknown.

Saturn's moon Titan was selected as the sight of the first ""moon harvest"", as it was known back then.  Saturn was as far from Earth as the consortiums were willing to work and still have reasonable access to timely supplies and support."

"TEACHER REPORT: 3rd semester, 381-3

I know kids are supposed to have a vivid imagination, but this is getting ridiculous. Nearly half of my class has imaginary friends now, claiming that it's their deceased grandmother or something. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but it's getting harder and harder to get these kids to concentrate. This semester, I've sent more students to the time out chair than I have in all my twelve years of teaching. Maybe these kids are having trouble at home. I've also noticed parental involvement steadily decreasing this semester.

Dr. Heidi Latchford Research Summary Organic Material analysis: There are several shocking findings relating to the sludge-like material found throughout the Ishimura. First, it is human DNA. Second, and far more disturbing, it re-animates in the presence of a Marker signal. The only conclusion we can come to is that the entire Ishimura crew was infected and "reconstructed", and then fell into a soupy DNA-sludge when the Aegis VII Marker was destroyed.

The Rivet Gun 3000! New heat sink technology allows for hotter pellets at a faster firing rate!  Be sure to keep the safety on when not in use, and never point live mining tools at people or ship hulls.  As always, trust Timson Tools for all your mining operations!
Rivet Gun 3000, new from Timson Tools!   Enhanced heat-sink technology allows for faster firing rates and hotter pellets.     Handy in every situation, from heavy duty ship repairs to light hull patch work, never spacewalk without one.  Remember, safety should be on unless in use, and never point live mining tools at people or ship membranes.
The 711-MarkCL Rivet Gun is the latest refinement from Timson Tool's long line of friendly tools.   Thanks to the latest in machine action loading,  the Rivet Gun is ready to fire as fast as you can pull the trigger.   This allows for quick multiple rivets during narrow windows of alignment in tricky zero-G maneuvers.   Minimized kickback and electromagnetic shielding provide safe, hot rivets in even the most delicate, or dangerous, of environments.   Good for temporary patch jobs, or heavy duty hull repairs, this little workhorse will get you back to the stars in no time.  Remember, safety should be on unless in use, and never point live mining tools at people or ship membranes.

"TPS REPORT: Crypt Ops Temperature
Crypt Officer: Sizzle, Jay

The software glitch that caused the thaw and loss of 2 bodies last week has returned.   We were able to switch the majority of section 1 over to manual  control before any significant rise in temperature.   I still suspect the EarthGov officers that were denied access to the crypt last week are somehow responsible.   It may prove to be otherwise, but the timing of their visit and the error is too coincidental.

We will reformat the operating system tonight, eliminating any chance of possible infectious software.   I'll pull a triple shift to ensure all goes well.

Sizzle out."

TITAN STATION:  CONQUERING A MOON, PART 2 of 2

A large colony was established on Titan to study the moon's every seismic detail and prepare it for disassembly.   As the operation got under way, the orbital platforms that assisted with the work became the prototypes for the planetcrackers that would soon follow.

Titan was sucessfully ""cracked"" and harvested, only slightly behind schedule.   It was a major boost for the then-beleaguered population on Earth, who believed their extinction from lack of resources was imminent.

Titan's harvest was halted before the entire moon was dissembled, leaving the small shard where the original colony had started.   From here, the station grew in leaps and bounds as the new era of planetcracking got underway, serving as both a critical research outpost, and with the advent of shockpoint drives, a way station for all planetcracking missions going forward.

It is now whimsically known as the Sprawl, for having done just that over the many years of its operation."

Please refer all registrants complaining of anxiety and/or psychological problems to the other hospitals in the area.  We're booked and running low on mood-elevating medications.

Crypt Sergeant Khoury reporting. Direct orders today from Vested Member Odwick, fully paid, to clear all of Crypt bays  2 and 3 for new arrivals.   Martyrs, actually, he said.   The covert operations are about to start.  We may get as many EarthGov bodies in here as we do Church Operatives.  We can only hope.   And we need to be ready in 12 hours. I've authorized disgorgement of bays 2 and 3 to the Castle of Spirits mortuary ship, tethered at docking arm Theta 9.   It will take at least 12 hours to float all the caskets along the outer hull route, even with all the tugs in operation.  Looks like Earth Gov is about to get a big dose of what they've been handing out lately. - Altman Be Praised.

Chemical tank?  Nitrogen Trichloride.  Those explode if they overheat!
How's the big chemical tank explosion going?
Why did Tiedemann turn off power? What did you do to piss him off so much?
Yeah, the Unitologists on my crew wouldn't shut up about it.  Why?   Is it real?
You're a strange man, Isaac.
We're about to suffocate. So, I think I'd better. 
"Yes, the solar arrays up there!
But they've been mothballed for years."
You'll need someone to open the collector panels. I can do that.
Shhhh!... Shut the power off, you can hear noises three blocks away. He's going to give away my position!
Here comes the transport, everybody get ready in case there's more.
How do you think he's doing? Can you hear this shit?
Kaleb, come on!  More are moving in ahead of us!  I can see them!
"We're on our way. I'll contact you soon.
Hey, Twitchy, this way. No, this way! Come on."
Yes we are.
See for yourself...
He stopped hyperventilating but I don't know how much longer he's going to last. I knew he would just slow me down.
Isaac! I can't find him! Stross ran off into the dark!
I know! I know! I'll get it done. The collector's just ahead. You get that beam working! Stross?! Stross! Oh God, that guy needs serious help.
`
`
Holy shit Isaac!
We just made it into this crossover tube when the beam hit!  Isaac, those things are still heading for the Transport Hub.  They're wrecking everything in their path!
Right outside! Hurry!
Isaac! This way! The train is this way.
Oh shit!
Are you crazy? I barely made it out of there with my life! That place is swarming with those things!
What are you talking about?  Just get your ass in here, I'm starting a system check now. 
No, get up Kaleb, just a few more meters!
No, Kaleb...Kaleb
And here I am again. I just walked one big fucking circle today.
No!  Somehow Tiedemann declared me dead in the system, now my codes won't work anymore!
{g} (equipped)
Oh Shit! Something's coming! Stross! Help me with the door!
What?! No! Just shut up and help me!
God dammit! Aarrgh!!!
We'll be right there. Stross, come on. Come ON!
Isaac, we have to get out of here.
Yeah, used to be the pride of the CEC. Sad story, actually. I heard everybody onboard died - some sort of terrorist attack.
What do you mean?
I... I don't know.  Something must be blocking the track.

What?! Are you crazy? That big one? If you set that off in here it will incinerate everything!
congratulations
I can't make it go any faster!
 Isaac, what does he mean? What did  he mean when he said dead weight?
He... he cut the station in half. There's no track to get across on.
What?  Why?
you can snare Gov Sec and drag it back. Isaac, this is ridiculous.
Isaac, no, this is a really bad idea!
You did it! Get back here! The tracks are moving! 
Isaac! We crossed the track... but we're coming in hot!
Stross! Put down the screwdriver!
Isaac!
Argh! Fuck you!
Isaac, over here! It looks like the mechanic was dragged away before he could finish fixing this. 
Well, I'm not sorry about that.
So what happens now? I thought you needed Stross to destroy the Marker.
What about you?
Alright.  I'll see what I can do from up here.  
It's been a long time since I've been in one of these. 
Now I see why this thing was just sitting here - the wiring is a mess. 
The engineer responsible for this should be shot - except he's probably already dead. Now I feel bad for saying that.
Come on! Dammit. I'm going to have to strip these wires. 
This would be a lot easier if I had any depth perception!  
Hey, what'd you do?  I just lost the control holograms.
Well it's standard, there should be another one around here somewhere.
Well, no, not now.
Great.  I think I've hotwired the system to bypass the navcards.  Thank God.
I think I've got it from up here.
What?  Didn't hear you.
I did it!  I got it started!
There's a lift on the other side. I'll turn around and you can get on.
Alrighty, let's see what this beast can do...
Looks like we've reached the foundation pylons of the Government Sector.  
Straight ahead.  We do have a giant drill. 
Well, we can compare bruises later. But at least we made it, right?  And this is most definitely government sector - and I'm guessing that Marker of yours is behind that huge door over there.
Alright, I'll meet you halfway.
No, guidance systems are out... but life support's on-line. Comms too...
Hull integrity looks sound.
Isaac, take a look at this!
Isaac? You're still out there, right?
Isaac... what are you doing?
Whoa, hey Isaac what are you doing?

Isaac, over here!! The door is jammed. This must have been the last stand for whoever was left down here.
No the circuits are fried. They must have fused the panel trying to keep those things out.
The only way around is through the processing plant, but it's not meant for human traffic. I think I can stop it from here though. 
Isaac! We have to cross to the Government Sector before they cut us off!  You'll never make it down here in time!
Isaac!  What are you doing? Open the door right now!  No. No! No, don't you dare, don't you dare launch this ship!
Isaac...
...you bastard...
Isaac, it's Ellie. I've found someone. Another survivor. He says he knows you. I said stand still!
Shit. Ok, Isaac. I'll march him to the hub but if he does anything stupid, ANYTHING, I will shoot him.
That figures.
This is going to be trouble.
Shit!
I'm trying to roll back the cover now.  Stross, can you give me a hand with this?
I promise I'll protect you, now just get over here and give me a hand.
There's something covering the collector panel. Oh my God, there's hun-- there's thousands of them.  They're breaking apart! 
Shit, Isaac.  Just...shit!
No, it's not!  I was right here this morning with a crew of thirty people. But we were overrun, and before I knew it they were all transformed. I had to cut the arms and legs off my friends just to escape.  I'm sure there's pieces of them still lying around here somewhere. 
Right. There's a central Hub in the main facility. Here are the coordinates.
Right... Manually shutting down the plant froze all the pressure valves in place. You'll need to find a way to force it open.
Not really!
Move Stross!
Oh God, Isaac!  Glad to see you've got all your parts!
Um, yeah. 
It's getting worse.
There's an Industrial Transport upstairs. Runs on the same spoke as the commuter train. It should get us to the government sector. One of us will have to deploy it from the gear house.
Okay.  I've almost got us disconnected from the mag-rail.  Keep me posted.
Alright.  The centrifuge looks spooled to full power from here.
All set. I'll wait for your signal.
You owe me an eye, you bastard!
Isaac, he's run off, deeper into the mines!
I'll try.
I'm safe for now, but he's lost it. I think he's coming for you. I've found something you're gonna wanna see. Here's my location. Hurry and get here, I'm not in any shape to be fighting. 
You complete bastard! Was this your great plan?  Dump me off and die? 
Yeah, well, here's another one: I'm crashing through the roof to get you. Now move your ass!
Yeah, well you don't really have a say this time.  Heads up!
Isaac!
The station's coming apart!
Isaac!
We're not gonna make it!
Isaac, take my hand!
Shut the hatch!  Shut the hatch!
What?
Isaac, Stross is starting to worry me, listen...
Stross! He's not real!
Stross, put down the screwdriver!  Argh!
This is the last stand!
Piece of shit, come on...
You wanna piece of me, huh? 
What? What? I'm still here, huh, come on!
Yeah, come on I dare ya! Come on!
Yeah, you like that, huh? You like it! Well, come and get it!
Yeah, come on! You like this! Come and get it!
He looks... twitchy. I don't trust him. Don't move!
Isaac, I'll try to open the CEC door on your level, hold on! 
Piece of shit Lock.  I'm giving it my codes but it's not working.
Yes, I'm authorized for this!  Open up you bastard!
There! It's open!  Isaac, go!
Go Isaac! You can't stop them all! Go!
Main power - ON
...auxiliary systems - booting up...
   Get to the Cassini Residential Sector.
...main engines - fueling confirmed...
Huh, I think this bird might fly.
Oh, looks like the Nav is shot though.
Watch the debris!
Isaac!
 (panicking) Kaleb, come on!  More are moving in ahead of us!  I can see them!
Kaleb, NOW!
Here comes the transport, everybody get ready in case there's more.
Kaleb, it's more of them!   Shoot them!  SHOOT THEM!
Yes we are.
No, get up Kaleb, just a few more meters!
No, Kaleb... Kaleb.
Ellie:   Two should be enough to move it back onto the mag rail.  Shoot the red tips to ignite them.
 No, I don't have some magic panel that opens all the doors in the Sprawl.  Is his body around there anywhere?  Maybe you can use it to fool the door?
Try configuring the fuses to match the floor diagram.  That should bring up the command podium.   I used Kinesis on the fuses.
It's strange, but yes.
Isaac, okay I can see the Array from here.   It looks like you need to go to the outer dishes and find a way to drag their beams onto the center column.
I know, you'll have to stasis the machines to create an opening to fly through.
 There should be thrusters stored in there somewhere, the ones with the red tips.   Use one to force the door open.
Really?  It won't work unless all the cooling tubes are connected.
This will increase the damage of ALT FIRE

Chapter 10
previously on Dead SpaceÂ¬
 You'd better hurry, the Gov Sec is getting further away by the minute.
Isaac, did you find the other Power Cell yet?
Hmm, I'm having trouble getting it to recognize the new junction.
Yeah okay, I'll keep working on it from up here.
Yeah okay, I'll keep working on it from up here.
<vocal react>
Shit!
...oh God, they're heading this way!  Run Stross, RUN! 
Twitchy, let's move!  Move!
Here they come!
They're everywhere!
Stross, look out!
I can't hold them back!
I need some help up here!
Get behind me!
Where do they keep coming from?
They keep coming!
Stay back!
There's too many!
Stay behind me!
There's more coming from over there!
They're coming from both sides!
I can't stop them all!
<vocal react>
That was really unpleasant.
These bastards are everywhere...
The mines are swarming with these things.
If there're this many down here, how many do we think are above us?
Hang on. We're coming up on more of that stuff. Sorry...
You okay out there?
They're climbing up the sides!
I can't.
Holy shit, Isaac, look out!  It's headed for YOU!
 Isaac, are you alright?   I think that's all of them, for now...
No more?   That can't be all of them.
Is... that all of them?
Come on, I know there's more of you.
Sneaky little bastards, I can hear you.
Just stop hiding you little freaks.
Yeah yeah, I see you down there.  
Ugh, this silence is worse than anything.
Two should be enough to move it back onto the mag rail.  Shoot the red tips to ignite them.
No, I don't have some magic panel that opens all the doors in the Sprawl.  Is his body around there somewhere?  Maybe you can use it to fool the door?
Try configuring the fuses to match the floor diagram.  That should bring up the command podium.   I used Kinesis on the fuses.
It's strange, but yes.
Isaac, okay I can see the Array from here.   It looks like you need to go to the outer dishes and find a way to drag their beams onto the center column.
A big tank?  Nitrogen Trichloride.  Those explode if they overheat!
How's the big tank explosion going?
There should be explosive canisters near you?  Launch a few at the tank, that should do it.
What?! Are you crazy? That one in the middle? If you set that off it will incinerate everything in here!
Look out, there's more coming from holes in the walls.
I know, you'll have to stasis the machines to create an opening to fly through.
There should be thrusters stored in there somewhere, the ones with the red tips.   Use one to force the door open.
No surprise there.
Isaac, I've logged into the Transport maintenance records.  It says the primary gearbox is offline?   Does that make any sense for what you're seeing up there?
That worked, we're moving again.   We'll wait for you up ahead.
This whole place is going to blow!   Get up here, fast! Isaac!
Kaleb, it's more of them!   Shoot them!  SHOOT THEM!
Kaleb, NOW!
Are you okay? You sound a little nervous.
What?
Is it safe?
Isaac!  Isaac, they're swarming into the ship!
Just be careful.
Really?  It won't work unless all the cooling tubes are connected.
You'd better hurry, the Gov Sec is getting further away by the minute.
Aw Isaac... dammit that hurts. The bastard bit me.
Yeah I'm fine.  But he's stopped talking, and won't look at me. How's it going on your end? And please tell me this plan is going to work!  
Well good.   They're swarming in through a hole in the Medical Deck.  At least you won't have to go through there.
Isaac, what are you doing? I thought you said you were heading back up to the tram? Just retrace your steps back up to the tram tunnel.
 Isaac, did you find the other Power Cell yet?
Yep.
How's the hunt for a circuit junction going out there?
The spinny thing up there should have one inside it.
7
Otherwise known as a Bercolite 300 seismic coring stabilizer.   It spins.   Spinny thing.
Hmm, I'm having trouble getting it to recognize the new junction.
Yeah, see what you can do.
Isaac, there's a gunship docked here! 
Not that I can tell!  Isaac, do you hear me? We're going to make it out of here alive!
...No thanks to twitchy here.

"Altman's Footsteps
A publication for the followers of Michael Altman

We, the children of the Marker, grow tired of the oppressive, thinly-veiled attacks from EarthGov on our rights to worship as we please.  Reduced hours of operation for the Church, fire marshal restrictions on the size of revival events, permits needed to distribute literature.   These are all poorly concealed attempts to quash the Truth.  OUR TRUTH.   And they will not succeed.   The blasphemous, short-sighted, reckless, destructive and hopeless path that EarthGov has us on is a dead end.  One that only Unitology has the answer to.  Altman has foreseen it, and we are blessed to execute it.  Prepare yourselves brothers and sisters, Convergence is nigh."

Why?  What's going on?
No, no, it's ok. It's ok. How you doing?
Well enjoy it while it lasts. You know they're going to decommission her next year.
For what?
Well, just remember, I'm giving you up for six months so you can do this.
Isaac? Isaac? Can you hear me? I'll call you as soon as I can okay?
I fell into a Surgery Pit, I'm locked in.
I'll look around.
Daina, there's a security lockdown!  I'm trapped!
Look, I don't need your help.
aw shit.  
Daina?  Daina! Okay, you're right.  I do need your help.   Talk to me.
Oh yeah..
Where , where am I?
Holy Shit!
Jeezus that thing was angry. Daina?  I'm out of the hospital.
Hang on. I need more answers.  How long have I been here?  
Why can't I remember anything?
You said you could fix it, right?
Listen to me man!
Listen to me!
We can both get out of here. Just, just cut me out of this straightjacket!
Take it easy buddy... just take it easy.
Daina, I need a new route.
Unscheduled stop. Where am I?
Everything's going to hell and they're still chasing me?
Daina, some crazy guy keeps contacting me. I saw him back at the hospital.
Yeah? Well, I think he wants something.
I'll be careful.
Daina, I thought you were routing me to residential. This looks like... a Unitology recruitment center?  Am I still on track? 
Daina! Tiedemann's soldiers have found me! They're tracking me in some sort of gunship!
Daina, what the hell route is this?
Fly against the flow of the garbage.  Wonderful.
Daina?  The Church of Unitology?  Why here?
No, Daina, we shouldn't be in here.  This is the last place we want to be right now...
Stross. Yes I see the symbols. 
Work together?  Who's them? You mean Tiedemann?  Stross?  Work with me Stross!
Dammit!
Daina I'm locked out. There's something in the church. It broke the door!
 Daina you still with me? I've reached the top of the church.
No, but I think I've seen it.
Nicole...?
Right.  thanks.
Holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!
I don't understand.  What steps?
Oh God, Ellie!
Stross!  What are you...Hey!...Stop!
Stross, Stop it!  It's me!  It's Isaac!
Stross! STROSS!
You sure this is the right way? How can you tell where you're going?
Daina, the door to the ER doesn't recognize me.  It's closing before I can get through.
Stasis.  Got it, thanks.
I know.  I've had a lot of pracice.
Thanks.
What the fuck?
Holy shit!
Whoa, are you...hold on...let me....oh shit!  FUCK!  
Hey!  Hey!

Why are you doing this? Why can't everyone leave me alone?
What are you talking about?
You people are unbelievable. Just give me the fucking cure and let me go.
Take it easy. I'm not going to hurt you...
Look, I think we got off to a bad start here. I'm Isaac.
I'm trying to get to the Transport Hub. I need to get to the Government Sector.
Hey I can help you. Besides, we got a better chance if we stick together. Don't you agree?
I'm not listening to this. You may fool Stross, but I know you're not real.
 You're just a hallucination! Stross knows how to destroy you!  He knows how to destroy the Marker. We will destroy you!
Wait, you're CEC?
Engineer.
Are you insane? You cut off power to life support! There may be other survivors over here!
Ellie... Do you know what a marker is?
Yes it's real. Tiedemann made one using codes, patterns stored in our heads...mine and Stross. Everything that's happening on this station is happening because of that Marker. I have to get to it and destroy it and I need Stross to tell me how.
Will you help me?
Ok good, listen we need power.  Without it we have no air and no train. The Sprawl's gotta have back-up batteries somewhere.
Ok... alright , good. I'm heading there now.  If I can start them up and get some power to the train.
Take Stross. Keep him safe.
Ellie
How's Stross doing?
Ellie, try to keep him focused. I need to know what he's trying to tell me.
Ellie, I ran into a snag. It looks like the Docking Pod that runs to the Solar Array is floating at the bottom of the shaft.
Don't worry, I can fix this. I'm heading outside to have a look.
He's hallucinating, Ellie. It's part of the sickness.
Stross, what's wrong? Ellie?
Ellie, it looks like two of the mirrors are out of alignment. How's he doing?
If Stross dies, so do my chances of destroying the Marker. Keep him alive and get to that panel.  
Dammit! We'll have to look for him later. Ellie, you have to get to those panels!
Ellie, get out of there...
ELLIE! Ellie come in!  Ellie!  Shit.
Ellie?! Ellie, are you alright?!
Oh shit, they'll cut us off! Get to the hub!  - I'll meet you as soon as I can!

Ellie? Are you guys there? Did you make it?

It doesn't have to be this way, Tiedemann!
I think I've hit a dead end. Looks like some kind of venting system up ahead.
Ellie, can't you shut these things off?
All right, I've released the Transport. Meet me at the landing.
Get out of my head! You're not Nicole!
Stross, listen to me, listen to me!
Right. Let's go.
Oh my God!  It can't be - that's the Ishimura...

Hey, what's happening?
Stay here.  I'll take a look.
Ok, Ellie! Get ready, one more!
Yes it will.  Tell Stross to hold on, here we go...
Ugh! Uh! Go! Go! Go!
Oh. God. Come on.

Stross! God dammit!
Oh God, Ellie!
Shut up! Just shut... up! The Marker... It was you... you made him do it! You made me kill him, didn't you?
You're nothing... you can't hurt me... you are not real... you can't... hurt... me...
Cause you were my everything. And if I let you go, I got nothing left. 
Stross is dead, Ellie. 
Stross couldn't lead us to the Marker. He was running away from his guilt.
Yeah, the circuit junction shorted out.  I'll have to find another one.
I'll look.  Any luck up there?
Right.
Found it.
Yeah.
It doesn't recognize the new junction. 
Or maybe just rewire it from down here.
Nothing... Nothing.
Uh...
Thanks
Ok I'm on! 
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Stop!  STOP!  
So how do we get in there?  
You know I'm riding on top of this thing, right?  Ellie?  Ellie? Ellie! Ellie! Ellie!
Ugh! Holy crap that hurt.
Why?  So I can let you go too?  I can't do that Nicole.  I never wanted to let you go. 
What is that? I can feel it in my head.
I still don't know what to do.
Oh my God. I built that?
What - what are they doing?

The Machine, just like Stross said. I remember this. The machine activates the parts of our brain where the Marker codes are stored. But how does that threaten the Marker? What were they afraid of?
Step four.
This is going to hurt, isn't it?
Nicole... Where are you?
But what do I do?.... Dammit!
Good.
Wait... wait, not yet! I'm not ready to lose you again! Nicole! Can you hear me? Nicole?
Goodbye, Nicole.
You're kidding.
Ellie?  Ellie!
Can you get the door open on your end?
There has to be another way in.
Alright, do it.
Hold it together, Stross. I'll be there soon.
Ellie! Come in!
I'll be there!  I'll be there!
Well, we better move fast.  Those things are going to find a way up the hole we drilled. There's gotta be an elevator or something connecting these floors. I'm gonna try to make my way to you.
It's your best chance Ellie. You got life support, comms... Hey, you're gonna be rescued.
 I need you to be rescued.  I couldn't save Nicole, but I can save you Ellie. So, uh... bye.

The Marker.
It spoke to me...
Calm down, I'll cut you out of there.  Is that a tissue laser?  A plasma cutter?
Fuck.
Come on!
COME ON!
On this station?  Why?
Daina?  Dammit.
You're not Nicole! Nicole is dead! You're not really here.
Wait, Daina, this is a Church of Unitology. Where are you taking me?
Why are you following me?
Stross? Stross?
Hurry. There's something out here, too...
Daina, you there? 
Let me see what I can do.
Daina? Daina? Important that I what?
You mean the Marker? 
Do you know where the Marker is Stross?
Stross, Stross! Where are you going? Shit!
I don't remember any sessions. 
Who? Who comes back? Who?!
Stross, don't follow him! He's not really there!

Stross! Listen to me! You need to keep moving. Can you get to the train? Can you do that?
Ellie! Take it easy! His name is Stross. I know him.
Ellie! I need him to be - not dead. I need him.
Ellie, I've got the elevator repaired. I'm heading up to the array. How's Stross doing? 
It already is.  Just keep moving.
Ellie, I'm on my way to the mirrors now. I have to realign them manually. How's Stross?
Alright Ellie, one down.  How's it lookin on your end?
Ellie...I know, I'm sorry.
We'll get through this. Let's figure out how to meet up. 
Are you guys okay?
Hold them off, I think I'm close! 
You alright?
Jesus, Stross. You okay?   
What is step four? Who will be waiting?
He's not gonna make it.  We gotta keep moving.
Stay here and, uh,  try to get him on his feet.
Ellie, I've got the centrifuge on-line. I'm heading back towards the tram station.
Great.  Let's hope this works. It'll be tight, you ready?
Okay, heading in now.
Why did you do it, Stross?!
What can't you face?  What's the last step?
Stross!!!  Dammit!
I've got problems on this end too, get somewhere safe.
Ellie. I'm back inside.  Where are you?  Where's Stross?
I'll get there as soon as I can. Stay safe.
I don't know. 
Well, how was it supposed to happen, Tiedemann?
Why? What the hell is it doing?
I'm full of bad ideas, remember?
Wait! No! Ellie! Ellie, it's too late! Steer clear of the station!
I'm pushing it as hard as I can!
Almost there!
Yes we are, just hold on!
I'm trying!   I'm trying!
Holy crap!
Stross? 
Stross! Ellie?  Shit!
Aw fuck!
Shit, no waypoint.  What the hell?
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey!

Ellie, the door in here only opens for Howard Phillips, the station keeper.  But he's dead.  Can you open it?
Use his body to fool the door, okay, I'll try it.
Ellie, I need to get this mainframe offline.   I'm inside the core.
 You've done this before?
 Mmm. Tell me about it sometime.  But not now.   Kinesis, Fuses, match the floor panel, got it.  Thanks.
Okay, I'm on it.
 Ellie, this is a death trap!
Alright, this is going to be tricky.
 Ellie, another valve hatch is sealed shut.   I can't get through.
Alright, I look for them.
Ellie, the damn cooling core is extended and pieces are everywhere.
Yeah, I see tube paths on the floating components.   I think I can match them up with the right sockets.   
 I know, I'm going as fast as I can.   I'll contact you when I'm done.
I'll see if I can rewire it from down here?

How do you know that? How do you know all this about me?
Why should I trust you?
Fuck.
Why are you helping me?

I don't like this.  
I fell into a Surgery Pit, I'm locked in.
I'll look around.
Wait!  WAIT!  Who is?  Who's after us?
Daina, your fucking route didn't work.  There's a security lockdown!
Look, I don't need your help.
Aw shit.  
Daina?  Daina!  Okay, you're right.  I do need your help.   Talk to me.
Fine. So where the hell am I?  How did another necromorph outbreak get started?
Okay, I'm past the Morgue.  How much further?
Isaac:  Alright.
Jeezus that thing was angry. Daina?  I'm out of the hospital.
Hang on. I need more answers.  How long have I been here?  
Why can't I remember anything?
You said you could fix it, right?
Who are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.   Why are you calling me?!
ah Fuck!
There are necromorphs everywhere, is the entire Sprawl infected?!  How did this happen? The Marker was destroyed Daina, I destroyed it!

Hey Daina, there's this crazy guy that keeps contacting me. I saw him back at the hospital.
Yeah? Why was he there?  What does he want?
Okay, I'll be careful.
Daina, I thought you were routing me to residential. This looks like... a Unitology recruitment center?  Am I still on track? 
Daina! Tiedemann's soldiers have found me! They're tracking me in some sort of gunship!
Daina, what the hell route is this?
Fly against the flow of the garbage.  Wonderful.
Daina?  The Church of Unitology?  Why here?
No Daina, we shouldn't be in here.  This is the last place we want to be right now.
Dammit!  Figures
Daina I'm locked out. There's something in the church. It broke the door!
 Daina you still with me? I've reached the top of the church.
No, but I think I've seen it.

Right.  thanks.
Daina?! You're a Unitologist? Of course you are. Why did I trust you?

I don't understand.  
Whoa Stross!  What are you doing?!
Stross, it's me!  
Stross!
I'm not running anymore. I know what I have to do.  Well, this drill is a stroke of good luck, finally.  Why don't you get up to the cab try to get it started. I'll look for the other power cell.
At least you were in the cockpit...
Dammit! There's more of them out here. I'll try to keep them off us.
Oh, yeah.  Good times.
I'll try to keep them off! You just steer clear of those walls.
You sure this is the right way? How can you tell where you're going?
Daina, the door to the ER doesn't recognize me.  It's closing before I can get through.

Alright, alright I'll look for them.
Okay Ellie, I found the transport, but there's a problem with the release mechanism.
Yeah.  I'll let you know when it's fixed.
I think so, looks like I just need to find some spare parts.
Alright, I see you.  I'll meet you there.
Faster, Ellie! Faster!
Ellie, I'm in. There should still be a computer in the flight lounge. I can check the ship's status from there.
Last time I was here, things didn't go so well. Look, I'll contact you soon.
Damn it, that's what I thought.
The gravity centrifuge is under repair.  I'm going to have to go down to Engineering. This should be interesting.
I don't know how it could be.  I'll let you know. 
 YEAH I KNOW! I'll call you back!
Okay, no Ellie, it isn't safe.  But I'm on my way to the centrifuge.
 I'll call you when its online.
Ellie, the damn cooling core is extended and pieces are everywhere.
Yeah, I see tube paths on the floating components.   I think I can match them up with the right sockets. 
I know, I'm going as fast as I can.  Look, I'll contact you when I'm done.
What? Oh shit. Are you okay?
I'm almost there. I'm headed to the bridge now to activate the gravity tethers.
Crap. 
Alright, I'm on my way back up.
No, still looking.  Just one more, right?
Okay.
Fine.  Except I haven't found one yet.
Spinny thing.   
I knew that.  I'll get it, hold on.
I'll see if I can rewire it from down here.
What?  Is it damaged? 
One of us is.  It's too dangerous for you to stay here Ellie...
Crap, looks like I have to dodge these lasers to make my way around to the other side.  This'll be fun.

Golan, this is Hedrick.   You really don't hear anything when you're cleaning these bathrooms?  Every shift, I swear, I hear something in the walls, like a scratching noise.   When I stop moving, it stops.  When I move again, it waits a bit, then comes back.   Today, it followed me around, right under my feet, like it was stalking me. I... I...  I can't take this man.   This ship is cursed.  It is a bad, bad omen that it's here. I'm putting in for a transfer, you should too.
Golan, it's Hedrick. Did you come in last shift? Did anyone? I think it's just me down here now. I got lost last night when the lights went out....and I fell down a ramp. I think. Or someone tripped me. I'm all bruised on my left side and my ankle is swollen..are you sure you guy aren't down here? I hear something near my locker. Screw this, I'm heading up. I'm never coming back here again.
The Cathedral reported two pressure equalization cycles during services last Sunday.   The first was minor, and only blew some candle flames around, giving Pastor O'Brien a much needed, if unexpected, boost in his sermon.   The second cycle was more harsh, resulting in a pressure snap that popped peoples' ears and sent several to medical.  That was not needed.

Recruiting Report: Perry Gibeaux
Vested Member
Tithe status: Fully paid

Recruiting has slowed markedly in the last few weeks.  This is surely due to EarthGov's recent slander campaign, painting us as carpetbaggers and insurrectionists in the press.   Regents from the Churches at Venus WayPort and the Heliopause Observer are shocking in later this week to strategize a response.   Expect additional budget to be allocated to Public Relations and Media to combat this trend.  Also, the CEC layoffs continue to negatively affect recruiting targets, we're down almost 30% year-on-year.

Kinner Phelps, Research log 43-509. I can't stop thinking about the formulas from Patient 4's last session. They are so clearly ordered, they keep playing back in my mind. The final configuration seems within reach, I could almost solve it myself. It's funny, I was telling Travis the other day that it's almost like it "wants" us to succeed. I've never seen anything like it. Once we finally solve this heuristic stabilization problem, we should be able to start growing the layers of the Marker from the mineral baths. 
Kinner Phelps, Research log 43-545 I blacked out again last night.  Like before, I had apparently written several of Patient 4's formulas on my note pad.  However -- I had written complex combinations of his formulas.   Oddly, they are the complete heuristic sequencing algorithm that he gave out today.   I find this coincidence disturbing,  and I can still see the formulas behind my eyes. We'll try the reconfigured algorithm on the seed layers today.  We may have a real Marker layer by morning.
Kinner Phelps, Research log 43-546.   Success.   The Marker layer held up.   It is a fully expressed physical representation of the heuristic algorithms from Patient 4, with no breakdowns.   The construction schedule begins in earnest tomorrow.  Celebration is tonight, I hope I don't black out in the middle of the party.   I'm anxious, for some reason.  
Kinner Phelps, Research log 43-549 I blacked out early last night, and woke up this morning staring at a tiny fully formed version of the Marker in one of the crystal layer printing baths.   I had entered the entire heuristic sequencing algorithm.   I can still hear it in my mind, like a song now. I know the dementia-suppressors are working, but this is something entirely different.
Kinner Phelps, Research log 43-553 - I'm convinced we are puppets of some alien influence.  I no longer believe we are in control of this project, or ever were.  I believe even our rationalizations for this whole thing are an illusion, planted by the forces behind the original Marker, the Black one. We don't know how to make this thing.   It is making us make it.    And it's trying to get out.  Desperately. I'm under security watch after taking a sledgehammer to the tiny Marker I built last week.   We need to destroy everything we've built here, and destroy every record, every shred of research.   They were right the first time on Aegis VII -- this is beyond our ability to know or control! I have to go, my supervisor is whispering to the security guard.

Great work, Franco.   Be careful, he's been out a long time.
Franco?  Franco, what happened? Oh God... Isaac? Isaac Clarke!?  If you can hear me, run. RUN!
Clarke!   Isaac Clarke, is that you?  
My name is Daina.  I'm the one trying to rescue you...
You're suffering from a unique form of dementia Isaac, something you contracted on Aegis VII.
Your dementia will kill you.  But if you can get here I can treat you and get you to safety. 
Because I'm not the one shooting at you.
Just follow the route I'm sending you.
Isaac, what happened, are you alright?
If Tiedemann finds you, more people will die. 
Not if you follow my route.
You don't have to like it.   Just hurry, before you get locked in!
Isaac, where are you?  
Well, try to break the glass with something in the room.   
I told you to hurry!  How did you miss it? 
Fine! Let's see how long you last without it! 
Look, Isaac, we don't have to be friends. But like it or not, we're stuck together.   Tiedemann's your enemy, not me.    Alright,  I've found you a new route.
You're on Titan Station, orbiting Saturn. As for the outbreak... shit, Tiedemann's jamming my signal...
The ambulance bay is just ahead, you're almost out.
Okay, the tram station is just beyond the apartment blocks.
Three years.  Tiedemann found you floating in space near Aegis VII and brought you here for study.
The Marker you found imprinted your brain with a self-replicating signal.  The longer you're awake, the more the signal spreads.  It's killing you Isaac.  Tiedemann tried to keep it in check with memory suppressants.
Only if you reach me in time. Tram Station.  Get moving. 
You destroyed A Marker, Isaac. Tiedemann built another one.
It's powerful alien technology.  Tiedemann wants that power.  Get to the tram, it'll take you to the Cassini Towers Tram Station.
What happened?  I thought we lost you!
How did you end up there? Hang on. This won't be the most pleasant route, but it'll get you to the Cassini Towers residential sector.   Dammit! Tiedemann has your signal again. Keep moving!
You're very important to them, Isaac...Hold tight, I'll contact you soon!
He's a psychopath Isaac, stay clear of him.  He murdered his own wife and child.
Yes.  There's an old maintenance access point in there that will take you through the waste disposal system and into the Cassini Towers.  Stay sharp.
You're almost here! Hurry.
Sorry Isaac.   You'll have to fly against the flow of the garbage upstream to get out.
It's Tiedemann! He's found you! Into the Church, hurry! 
 Isaac, my brother died trying to rescue you. This is important. This will work.  I'm in a safe room at the top of the Church. Meet me there, okay?
It's one of the few places on Titan Station that Tiedemann can't monitor. Separation of Church and State.  
Hang on, I'll try to override all the gates in the area.
Hurry. There's something out here, too...
You're almost here! I'll be waiting by the shuttle.
Isaac, have you gone through a small circular door in the roof yet?
Be careful, you'll have to time it just right, it's only open for a split second after a coffin comes through.  
They're Unitologists.  Everything everywhere is about coffins.
Is there a stasis module around there somewhere?  Try using one to slow down the door so you can get through.
Isaac, it's Daina.  You have to dismember the creatures to stop them.
Just try to stay in one piece.
Isaac, the people that ARE alive say they're using stasis to slow down the creatures!  
Isaac, I don't think I can...
Isaac, I can't unlock the elevator!  Can you do anything from your end?
Okay, once you're through you'll go through the Funerary wing of the church and down into the crypt. It's very important you're not ...
No! No, Earth Gov can't jam us in here! Not in here.
I don't know if you can hear me... You need... to go... up. Do you hear me? You need to go up.
Isaac? Dammit! I think they're jamming our signal with a mobile device. Someone get me the frequency on that jammer. They must have a gunship positioned near the compound!
No, if they knew where we were, they'd have killed us by now. Shit! Signal's fading! Just follow your locator and hurry!
Well, You didn't have a choice, Isaac. I told you there was a cure, and you came running.
"You're a dangerous secret, Isaac. Earth Gov won't leave you alone because they're afraid you'll destroy their Marker.
After all, you did build it."
Well, that's why we brought you here. To build Markers for us. To spread glorious Convergence to the entire galaxy. 
Oh, we don't want to cure you, Isaac! We need that precious little head of yours just the way it is. Now would you escort Isaac to the shuttle and put him in stasis. The last thing we want is for him to die. 
No!
Nolan Stross. He was a patient in the project just like you.
Isaac, it's Daina.  My operatives are saying you have to dismember the creatures to stop them.
just try to stay in one piece.
 Isaac, where are you?  
Well try to break the glass with something in the room.   
Is there a stasis module around there somewhere?  Try using one to slow down the door so you can get through.

This is Director Tiedemann to all project personnel. I want the key subjects terminated and the facility scrubbed. This is not a drill. Tiedemann out.
Attention. This is Director Tiedemann. A station-wide emergency is in effect. In accordance with Titan Station Civic Code, I am declaring martial law. All citizens are ordered to evacuate. Looters will be shot on sight. This is not a drill.  Move immediately to the nearest evac route. 
This is Director Tiedemann. All surviving squads are ordered to fall back. Repeat. Fall back to Government Sector. Operation: Endgame is in effect. Contingencies are in place to deal with our lost assets.
Our two remaining runners, Clarke and Stross. I knew it was only a matter of time before you reached the transit hub. You will find the train inoperable.
The public sector is already beyond acceptable recovery conditions. And I can't allow you to escape. Good-bye, Clarke. 
I'm sorry Clarke.  I know what you are trying to do, and I cannot allow you to succeed.  There is too much at stake. 
Clarke, there you are. I see your friend has powered off the facility.  Remind me to thank her for providing me with your location.  I've locked the processing cycle on, and you in with it.  It ends here, Clarke.
It does, and it is. Goodbye, Clarke.
In another situation, I might admire your persistence, Mr. Clarke. But this is bigger than you and bigger than the lives of everyone on this station.
It looks like this ends here. At this point, it's all just... dead weight.
Clarke! You idiot! Those gravity tethers will tear the whole moon apart! Cl...
I don't know what Providence protects you, Clarke, but it ends here. I have two hundred armed security personnel... Every entrance is covered! Even if you do get in, you won't get far.
Y-you compromised the compound, you... idiot! If any of them reach the Marker...
Fall back! Fall back to the Marker chamber! We have to seal it off!
Clarke! I knew you were trouble from the start! But they told me you were necessary. That your mind was the purest. I spent years sifting through your demented brain! This is not the way it was supposed to happen!
We had it under control! Clarke, this is not our fault! We were so close to understanding it!
What?  It's all those bodies. All those bodies you let in here! It's triggering  a Convergence event.  But, we never... expected... this many bodies...
Clarke, I know you're up there.  Understand that even if you survive long enough to restore power, there is no escape. All routes in and out of government sector are being monitored. Give up, Clarke.
Computer, this is Director Tiedemann. Disable all Solar Array functions immediately. 
The research in that Marker is worth every  life we just lost. 
I won't let you throw all this away.
Don't you dare tell me what I can and cannot do on my own station. My grandfather was running this place long before you were crapping your diapers, young man.    
I have spent my whole life in service of this community and I will not stand here and watch them die for some project protocols.    Now get to your shuttle, we can argue about this nonsense in court, assuming we both live to discuss your precious protocols.

The patients are becoming agitated and combative with us, as a result of the new regimens of memory erasing drugs.   They no longer remember who we are from day to day, and must be convinced to leave their cells each morning.   Many are so frightened they require sedation to get to the interrogation chamber.   Orderly Gousetis was bitten 3 times by Patient six, who now must be told why he has a broken jaw every morning.

By the 25th century, Earth's resources were ravaged. Consumed. Exhausted.
Desperate and on the verge of extinction, we cast out into the void of space and discovered rich new worlds waiting to be cracked open. And stripped bare.
All of Earth became devoted to this effort. The Planetcrackers were built, the USG Ishimura the first and most famous. Planetcracking became routine, its spoils kept us alive.
Eventually, greedy eyes fell upon Aegis VII. Restricted for centuries for reasons unknown, greed and corruption saw to the demise of caution.
There, buried beneath the surface. An artifact... 
The Red Marker... long lost and long forgotten.
The religion I once called my own had found its holy grail -- the key to human immortality...
...or so we thought.
It did not bring salvation...
It brought doom.
The Marker bred insanity, murder and chaos. It bred Necromorphs...
Those who escaped the planet fled to the "safety" of the orbiting Ishimura. 
But the scourge released upon Aegis VII came with them. 
Within hours, the Ishimura went dark.
The corporation dispatched a small repair crew to check on its investment. 
Among the crew was an engineer. Isaac Clarke. 
...he had something special aboard the Ishimura.
In the darkness, Isaac found death. 
And the Red Marker.
It was not holy, it was not alien, it was manmade. And it could be used to stop the outbreak.
Isaac also found Nicole. 
Dead by her own hand, she was an apparition of the Marker. 
Isaac engineered his escape...
...but everything else was destroyed.
Three years later, he wakes in a hospital on Titan Station, an Earth Gov metropolis on Saturn's largest moon. 
Isaac has survived. But his mind is no longer safe. 
For the Marker changes all.

Oh, God... I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing... I placed my faith in the Church and trusted them. What an idiot. Now there's something loose on the Sprawl, and the Church has abandoned me here!
Maybe I can make this right. Director Tiedemann asked me to repair the quarantine seal on Crossover Tube A. I don't know if I'll even make it there -- but it's my fault these things are loose in the first place. I have to try!
I'm almost at the Crossover Tube. If I can repair the seal, it'll stop the creatures from reaching the Public Sector. And then I'm going to tell everyone what the Church did!
Audiolog, RIG number 438642. These could be my last words. The monsters are loose. I couldn't stop them. And now the reactor core is overheating -- which will destroy the entire Sprawl if I can't fix it! So... I hope someone hears this. It means I did that much right, at least.

More Info
Welcome to the Titan Station Church of Unitology!  We're glad you've come to visit our sanctuary, and place of light and hope.  Our tour guides are looking forward to showing you the best of our beliefs, and what a meaningful and enlightening impact we can have in your daily life.   There is of course no obligation of any kind with this tour.  Kindly remember to stay with your tour guide at all times. Someone will be with you shortly.
Welcome to the Church of Unitology gift shop!  Find that special souvenir for that special someone to let them know you stood in the shrine of Altman today!  Marker pendants made from the fragments of Titan itself are now available!   Altman be Praised.
Behold the Church of Unitology reading room, a place of solace, a place of peace.  We invite you to sit by the hour and absorb the teachings of truth, unity and destiny.   Allow the comforts of the room to coddle your soul and soothe your weary spirit.  Maybe you too will can be lifted by the truths of Altman.  Only here, in the reading room of the Church.
In 2214, a geophysicist named Michael Altman made a discovery that would change history. Buried at the impact site of a crater near the Yucatan peninsula, he uncovered a divine alien presence - the Marker. The Marker spoke to Altman and revealed a plan that would unify mankind and lead them to a bright, new future.
By the millions, people flocked to hear more about the Marker and the unity it promised after Michael Altman told the world of his profound discovery.  But there were those who felt threatened by Altman's message. On March 15thÂ  2215, Altman was assassinated and thus became the first Martyr for the church.
Altman's followers mourned his death but found divine solace in his message of unity.  They would not allow the truth to be silenced and formed the Church of Unitology to bring his teachings to the world.
Today the Church of Unitology can be found everywhere in the known Universe. Its message is just as strong and relevant today as it was when Altman first revealed it. Billions of believers can be found across all social, economic and cultural groups and more are joining every day.
Growing from a small group of devout miners on Titan, the Titan Station Church of Unitology has flourished into a hub of Unitology worship, practice and learning. It boasts one of the largest and most beautiful Churches in the Sol system and is often the site of the annual Unitology Enigma Symposium.
As we await glorious Convergence, it is important to continue to nurture our relationship with the Marker and understand the future it is preparing for us. The Marker calls to all of us. It is our duty to approach it with an open heart and open mind.
Welcome to the Unity Hall. This magnificent library holds copies of the Church's most sacred texts and is a regular meeting place for the Unitology scholars as they debate the glorious mysteries of the Black Marker. Note the intricate details of the stained glass roof, forged from the hand-filtered sand of Titan itself!
Welcome to the basilica!   This hauntingly beautiful hall serves as the starting point for many of our formal ceremonies.   Its architecture is rich in symbolism, and the stained glass ceilings are forged from no less than the sands of Jupiter's long lost moon, Io, making them nearly priceless.   Enjoy the light and the love this room offers, as many have done before you.
Welcome to the Sanctuary, the heart of the Church.    All our formal ceremonies and civil proceedings take place here, under the watchful, wise and loving eye of our founder, Michael Altman.   This room is an exact replica of the lost Church of the Pleiades.  Stardust from the supernovae that destroyed it is imbedded in the gold masks of the Enigmas.  Here, there is only truth.   Here, there is only Unity.   Here, we are all made whole.
Welcome to the Church of Unitology Gift Store!  Pickup beautiful miniature replicas of the black marker, or statues of the Enigmas with their inspiring, mysterious gold masks, or even a mask itself!  What truth will you see in them?   What truth will they see in you?   We offer use of the standard workbench for free, as well as a general store.    Thank you for visiting the Gift Shop!
Welcome to the Titan Station Church of Unitology Library.    We have the largest collection of paper-style archives accessible to the public.   Most of these records were rescued from the Earth during the culture riots, and are now a priceless treasure of days past.  Some even date to before Michael Altman himself.   You will find extensive studies on the Black Marker from  Altman's own original transmissions, as well as forensic and other  well-documented evidence of the government's effort to cover it up.   Books may not be taken out of the Library, and please use your silence to respect those trying to study.     Thank you for visiting the Library, come back often!
Welcome to Indoctrination. A church seminar is currently in progress. Please wait for the next available church associate. Indoctrination is a pleasant, joyous event, where you will take the first step into glorious oneness that is...Unitology.   
Attention:  Please be quiet when observing the funerary rituals of the church.  Flash photography and holographic imaging are not permited inside the Church.   Thank you for your compliance.
Beyond these doors lies the Reading Room, a place where believers are encouraged to relax and meditate on the teachings of the Church. The shelves are lined with select inspirational materials as well as a variety of meditation aids. Please respect the sanctity of this space and those using it by remaining quiet and reverent while inside.

A shock mine should do it.   There's plenty of parts down here.
And stay together this time.
I hope this works, I don't wanna end up one of them.
Yep.   It's us or them.   Heat your tools, it's go time.
1 minute, we've got 1 minute!  Stay tight!
They killed him!   He was carrying the Klystron!  It's loose, someone find it!
Hold this area!
They're attacking the bench!  We can't let them destroy it!
But the bulkheads are sealed for the quarantine!  How do we get past those?
The quarantine has the bulkheads sealed tight.   We need a way in.
We're behind the quarantine bulkheads!  They're sealed!
Found the first set of controls.   Deactivating now.   Cover me!
First system down, head to the next one.
Overriding second panel, watch my back!
Door override complete!   Two more terminals up ahead.
Okay, activating first bridge bulkhead override, gimme a minute!   And try to keep them off me!
One more to go, find it! Find it!
Second panel, accessing.   Get ready.
The bridge is open, move out.   We have to activate the two priming stations, the pods are offline, dammit!
Engaging power transfer to the escape pod system, hold on!
It needs one more, someone get it.
Here goes, final priming station.    Everyone get ready!
Authorize the pods!  Authorize the pods!  It's the central panel!  Move move move!
Authorizing, hold it together!
Get to your escape pods!  Move it! Move it! Move it!
They'll be in two labs up ahead, but how do penetrate the code black lockdown?
Here's the power junction, aim for the core! Aim for the core!
And power's down.   Security doors should be open.   The first marker lab is just beyond, let's get moving.   It'll have a containment shield, we'll need to get that open.   Watch the corners!
Containment shield controls reached.   Retracting now, hold tight.
Containment shield's retracted! The Marker is exposed!  Target the Marker and open fire!
Keep firing!  Keep firing!   It's breaking down!
Marker down!  Alright, onto Lab 2.    We have another containment shield to get open
I've reached the next containment shield, I should have it open in a few seconds.  Watch my back!
Containment shields are open, target the marker and fire!
Oh yeah, last Marker, going down!   Don't stop, keep firing!
It's done!  We cleared all the Markers!  Alright, form up, back to base.
Alright, find and activate the transformer reset console, we need power first.
Let's get power on. Trip the breaker at the console up ahead. 
Power returning.   Get to the Security Door panel next. 
Security doors opening.    Get the disc and get upstairs!
I never knew these arrays could be used as weapons.    I thought they had safeguards to prevent this kind of use?
Oh.  Alright then.
Everyone, upstairs.   Plug it into the Intel center to load the coordinates.
Got the disc.
Oh shit, he was carrying the disc!   Someone grab it!
Disc installed, downloading coordinates.   We should go prime the two beam emitters, it's gonna take awhile.   We'll come back for this disc when we're done.
Beginning priming sequence at the first panel now.   Try to keep them off me!
First panel priming sequence completed.   There's one left, shouldn't be too far.
Initiating second priming sequence.
Second station priming complete.   We just need the disc we left down below.   The firing coordinates should be ready.  
Disc is in hand, coordinates are loaded.   These need to get this into the main array controls, let's go.
Ah crap!  We lost one, we lost one!  And he had the disc.   It's loose, find it!
Mission success, the array is firing!   Let's get back to base, he can't survive that.
Alpha team, your RIGs are flatlined, what's happening?  Report!  REPORT!
We'll have to clear the quarantine first, it's blocking us!
Found it!  Cover me.  Heading to ventilation.
Aw crap, he had the repair unit!  Someone grab it!
Unit installed, functioning.  Keep em off me!
We need another unit, they ganked this one!  Head back!
Ventilation repaired.   Head to the switch in the workshop!
Go go go!   Get the door codes downloaded at the main terminal!
Codes downloading to disc, hold them off!
Okay, I've got the disc with the codes.   Head to the security door!
save station
That's it, we're in!   Prime the detonator on the fuel core!  Move it!
Okay, here we go, priming detonator!  
Man down, data disc lost!  We need that disc!
Priming complete!  We have to protect the core!  1 minute left!
Fuckers!  Second unit destroyed!   Get the last one!
Repairs complete in 30 seconds, keep me covered!
Hold them off for 15 seconds, repairs almost done!
This unit's busted!  Get another, there's only two left!
We've got it, cover each other or we will never make it.
They Took him out, get it.
They Took him out, get it.
We've got it, cover each other or we will never make it.

"Chairman Donovan, this is Doctor Brooks. I've said this many times, and I'll say it again. I don't like the secrecy behind the new labs they've installed in the psych wing. It's been three years, and we don't have the faintest clue what's going on. Such secrecy has no place in an open and free society. Their networks are so isolated that we can't even tell they have one, let alone sift through it to see if anything unethical is taking place right under our noses.

If we don't get some traction on this soon, I'm going to go to Tiedemann, and insist on  formal review of these policies.

Right.  A Proton accelerator is the first piece. Heat your tools, here we go.
We got it!  We've got the first piece!   Now get the Proton Accelerator to the workbench.  Cover each other, or we'll never make it.
First piece secured!  We need the Klystron next.
The Klystron.  It forces the pro[tons]...shut the hell up.   Let's Head out!
Of course it'll work.  It has to.  The last piece is a Linac.   Should be easy to spot.
Me neither.   Last piece, let's go.
Charge cycle initiated, we've got 1 minute.  We have to protect the bench, or they'll tear it apart and disable the Mine!
Keep them away from this area!
The bench is under attack!  Keep them off it!
We got it!  We've got the first piece!   Now get the Proton Accelerator to the workbench.  Cover each other, or we'll never make it.
We can override them in the server room, but it's sealed too.   There's two terminals to override, move out!
The server room can override the bulkheads, but we have to break in.  Look for the two terminals!
The bulkheads can be opened in the Server room.  But the server room is sealed by two control panels, find them!
Here's the first controls for the Server doors.   Forcing shut down now.  
First controls deactivated.   Now let's get to the second one.
Okay, I'm at the second panel.   Deactivating, stand by.
Override successful.   Now hit the next two terminals!
Here's the first bridge bulkhead controls, I'm forcing the override now.   Hang on!
Get to the second terminal!
Forcing override, second panel.   We're almost there.
The pods are offline!   Get to the two priming stations, move move move!
Okay, priming the escape pod system, gimme a few seconds.
Find the other one, we need two!
Activating second priming station!   
Authorize the podsl, it's the last step!  The middle panel, go go go!
Entering authorization sequence now, hold on!
Escape pods are up!   Go go go!
The power junction to the security doors.   If we destroy it, they'll open right up.   
Okay, this is it, the power junction box.    Shoot for the core, any weapon.   Fire!  Fire!
We got it, junction is destroyed.   the first marker lab is be just after the doors.   Look for its containment shield controls!
Here's the containment shield controls, accessing now.  
I got em, the containment shields are open.   Hit the Marker with everything we've got!  Bring it down!
Don't stop firing, we've almost got it!
We got it!   The Marker's gone!  there's one left.   Let's get to the containment shield controls.
Okay, overriding the next containment shield, 
Okay, I got the containment shields open, let's blow this Marker away! Open fire!
Shoot it!  Shoot it!   Keep shooting it!  We've almost got it!
Boom, little tiny pieces!  No markers for you, bastards!  Let's get the hell out of here.
We need power.  Reset the Transformer console.  
Boom!  Power's back.   Next up, Security door override.
Override success.   Get upstairs with the disc!  The Firing coordinates are up there!
They do.  We're overriding them.
Man, I've never even seen these things turned on, much less used as a weapon.  
Upstairs, on the double.  Plug it into Intel, Tiedemann can upload firing coordinates from there.
Alright, I got the data disc.   
He's gone, the disc is loose!  Get the disc!  Get the disc!
Got the disc in, starting download.    The transfer rate is crap, we should get a jump on priming the two emitters while we're waiting.  We'll come back here after.
Priming sequence initiated, station 1.  I hear those things in the vents!  Watch out!

As a Human, aim at a necromorph player's limbs to take them out more efficiently.
Humans must finish their objectives before time runs out.  Additional time is earned for completing objectives.
Necromorphs have strength in numbers.  Gang up on human players for an easy kill.
Human skeletons can be seen through walls by necromorphs.
Follow your locator and on-screen objective icons to find your current objective.
Quick-heal will heal not only yourself, but any Human team-mates around you.
Initiate an execution to momentarily stop Humans and also get an XP damage bonus
Executions on low health Humans are very effective, and will often kill them.
Use TK on pick-up items in MP to quickly acquire them.
Don't forget to use the alternate fire on each of your weapons.
As you level up in Multiplayer you will unlock new weapons, upgrades, as well as suit skins.
The Pack has a very effective melee, slash away!
Stasis is crucial in MP - fire it at your enemies to slow them down and then dismember at will.

Chairman Donovan, this is Doctor Brooks. I've said this many times, and I'll say it again.   I don't like the secrecy behind the new labs they've installed in the psych wing.    It's been three years, and we don't have the faintest clue what's going on.   Such secrecy has no place in an open and free society.  Their networks are so isolated that we can't even tell they have one, let alone sift through it to see if anything unethical is taking place right under our noses.  If we don't get some traction on this soon, I'm going to go to Tiedemann, and insist on  formal review of these policies. - Dr Brooks out.

The kids are playing way too rough on the playground! Yesterday, I literally had a line of students with scrapes and bruises going out my office door. A few kids sustained injuries bad enough to need to go to the infirmary. Call me old fashioned, but I think this is the problem with kids growing up on a space station. Kids need a planet with fresh air and open ground to play on. Otherwise, they go stir crazy and start picking on each other. Space is no place to raise a family, if you ask me.

Roger that. I am notifying Captain Mathias and sending out a team to retrieve the payload.
"ISHIMURA RECOVERY INVESTIGATION:  
Report 765-8 - It appears a group of asteroid belt scavengers were responsible for finding the Ishimura.  They boarded it shortly after its disappearance from Aegis VII.    Their RIG's were running a poor man's version of an encryption baffler, but the sync tracking system has a decypherable imprint.   ""Benedykt Malyech"" and a woman named ""Jessica Li"" were in the brig for some reason when their RIG's flatlined.  ""Gatura Okeke"" flatlined in the engine room.  As with the Ishimura crew, their DNA showed up in the ""organic soup"" we found covering those areas.  However, a ""Stefan Schneider"" made his way to the bridge, where he stole an EVA suit and spacewalked out of tracker range.  We do have them to thank for finding the Ishimura, to be sure.   Black box telemetry shows the Ishimura was violently catapulted out of orbit when the gravity web collapsed between it, the colony and the extracted continent it was carrying.   We may never have found it with no clue where to look."

Marion, sorry I missed your call, I was busy at the Church thing I told you about. I know, I've been spending a lot of time with them, but I love it there. They're so welcoming and kind. They really like me. And they've invited me to become an Initiate! I think I'm going to do it. They've helped me see beyond our lives here in this universe, here in these bodies. There's a beautiful oneness waiting for us all, after this life of anger and sadness. and disappointment. There's a reading tonight at the Church sanctuary, so I may be there if you call. I hope to talk to you soon, and don't worry about those forms they sent you, I can explain. k, bye, love you!
